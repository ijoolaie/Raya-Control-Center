# Internal Security Review Preparation

Status: in progress  
Review type: internal code and test inspection; **not an independent security review**  
Review date: 2026-11-07  
Reviewed commit: 3b586e724b5d992c497c24015b9f33de3e00bec5

## Scope

This review is limited to the Raya Control Center repository and its current local-only deployment:
- HTTP server, route and Host validation, request parsing and resource limits
- operator, participant, and lease credential boundaries
- task lifecycle, lease ownership, revocation, cancellation, and recovery
- SQLite transactions, migrations, and append-only audit events
- backup and restore paths
- dashboard authentication, browser storage, and response security headers
- packaging and runtime assumptions

No remote ingress, tunnel, reverse proxy, or port-forwarding behavior is in scope for enablement. The service must remain bound to loopback.

## Review rules

- Findings must cite concrete code paths and observable behavior.
- Severity describes the impact under the documented single-machine threat model.
- A control is not considered independently verified merely because its implementation or an internal test exists.
- Do not claim a security certification or independent-review completion.
- Track remediation with a regression test and CI evidence.

## Confirmed observations

SEC-001 was remediated in commit `ba933f23d2a21824b50eeb64c863aa070cb32ea3` and the historical-retention clarification was recorded in `a72518058433e2639acec795fe2dcbdb5e4f5d26`. GitHub Actions push and pull-request workflows for the reviewed head both passed on Node 24 / Windows and Node 26 / Windows. This is implementation and CI evidence, not independent verification.


### SEC-001 — Untrusted worker-supplied content is copied into audit event data

Severity: **Medium**
Status: **Remediated for new events; CI verified on 2026-11-07**

Evidence (pre-remediation):
- src/control-center.js previously copied progress message, failure reason, and full completion result into appendEvent.
- listEvents returned parsed event data to Operator callers.
- docs/SECURITY.md prohibited secrets and sensitive content in audit events.

Impact:
Before remediation, a Participant could cause arbitrary free-form content to be retained in the immutable event journal, creating an unnecessary second copy of potentially sensitive Task data.

Remediation:
- Schema migration 5 adds tasks.result_json. Successful completion results remain available as task.result without being copied into audit events.
- Progress events now store only the percentage; progress message/details remain on the Task record.
- Failure events store no free-form reason. The input remains accepted for API compatibility but is not persisted.
- Security and integration contracts now warn that Task payloads, progress fields, and results are persisted and must not contain secrets.

Verification:
- Unit tests prove completion results remain on the Task and are absent from audit events.
- Unit tests prove failure reasons and progress message/details are absent from audit events.
- HTTP contract tests verify result availability to the completing client while audit history contains only a result-present flag.
- Backup validation and restore tests cover schema version 5.

Residual risk:
Task payloads, progress data, and successful results remain persisted in the Tasks table and are available to authorized clients. This remediation removes duplicate retention in the immutable event journal for new events; it does not detect secrets or encrypt application data at rest. Existing event rows are not rewritten or deleted because the journal is append-only. Any sensitive values already recorded before this fix remain in the live database and in backups made before cleanup.
### SEC-002 — Host and request-target parsing accepted alternate authority forms

Severity: **Medium**
Status: **Remediated; CI verified on 2026-11-07**

Evidence (pre-remediation):
- `src/http-server.js` parsed the raw Host header by prepending `http://` and checking only the resulting URL hostname.
- A Host value such as `attacker.example@localhost` is parsed with hostname `localhost` and username `attacker.example`; the old check therefore accepted a malformed authority containing userinfo.
- The request handler constructed a URL directly from `req.url`; absolute-form and network-path request targets could supply a different authority while routing continued from the parsed pathname.

Impact:
The Host allowlist did not strictly validate HTTP authority syntax, and request-target authority was not constrained to origin-form. This created inconsistent interpretation of the authority used for loopback validation versus request routing.

Remediation:
- Reject authority values containing whitespace, userinfo delimiters, path separators, query/fragment delimiters, or percent escapes before URL parsing.
- Require the parsed authority to have no username/password, path, query, or fragment, then apply the existing exact loopback hostname allowlist.
- Accept origin-form request targets only; reject absolute-form, network-path, backslash, and fragment-bearing targets before URL parsing.

Verification:
- Raw HTTP regression tests verify `attacker.example@localhost`, path-bearing, query-bearing, and fragment-bearing Host values receive HTTP 421.
- Raw HTTP regression tests verify absolute-form, network-path, and backslash-bearing request targets receive HTTP 400.
- The existing non-loopback Host test continues to verify safe error output.
- Targeted HTTP tests: 18/18 passed locally; full suite: 58/58 passed. GitHub Actions run `42351515683` passed on Node 24 / Windows and Node 26 / Windows.

Residual risk:
This closes the observed userinfo and alternate request-target authority gaps. Broader adversarial HTTP parser coverage remains open; this is not an independent review.

### SEC-003 — CLI API override could send the Operator token to a remote host

Severity: **High**
Status: **Remediated; CI verified on 2026-11-07**

Evidence (pre-remediation):
- `src/cli.js` accepted `RAYA_CC_URL` without validating its protocol, hostname, or path.
- Operator commands attached `RAYA_CC_OPERATOR_TOKEN` as a Bearer authorization header to requests sent to that URL.
- The reference worker already enforced an HTTP loopback URL, but the CLI did not.

Impact:
A user or process setting `RAYA_CC_URL` to an attacker-controlled remote URL could cause CLI operator credentials to be transmitted to that host. This contradicted the documented local-only deployment model.

Remediation:
- Validate the CLI base URL at startup; allow HTTP only, exact loopback hostnames only, no userinfo, and exactly the `/control/v1` path with no query or fragment.
- Fail before issuing any API request when the override is invalid.

Verification:
- Integration tests reject HTTPS remote hosts, HTTP remote hosts, URL-userinfo tricks, lookalike hostnames, unexpected paths, and query strings.
- Tests verify the operator token is not echoed in the error output.
- Targeted CLI tests: 7/7 passed locally; full suite: 58/58 passed. GitHub Actions run `42351515683` passed on Node 24 / Windows and Node 26 / Windows.

Residual risk:
Environment variables remain under the control of the local user/process. This validation prevents accidental credential forwarding to non-loopback URLs; it does not protect against a malicious process that can alter the user's environment or executable files.

## Backup and restore hardening in progress

The implementation now uses `lstat` for endpoint checks so the final source/destination path component must be a regular file; directories and final-component symbolic links are rejected. WAL/SHM sidecar presence is checked without following a final-component symlink. Restore validates the staged copy after copying it, rejects symbolic-link/junction components in source and destination paths, and installs the file through a same-directory hard link that cannot overwrite a destination created concurrently. The original database is moved to a unique rollback path first; rollback failures are surfaced with the preserved backup path. Regression tests reject directory inputs and destinations, reject symbolic-link/junction parent components, and verify the live database remains intact. Local validation for the current working tree: `npm test` 61/61 and `npm run check` passed on Node.js 22.23.2. The backup/restore code in commit `b8fb7f1` passed Node 24 and Node 26 Windows CI.

Backup/restore fault injection now covers both installation failure with successful rollback and rollback failure. The first case verifies the original live database is restored with all committed records intact. The second verifies the original database remains preserved at the reported rollback path when the rollback rename itself fails. Windows directory junctions and symbolic-link parent components are also covered by regression tests. Same-directory installation no longer overwrites a destination that appears concurrently. Concurrent ancestor replacement, non-NTFS hard-link behavior, and permission/ACL behavior still require review and targeted tests. Do not treat these changes as protection against a hostile process running with the same Windows user privileges.

## WAL recovery and process termination

The WAL recovery regression launches a child process, opens an immediate write transaction, confirms the uncommitted update is active, and forcibly terminates that process. Reopening the database recovers the prior committed task state (`queued`), and a truncate checkpoint succeeds. The test passed in CI on Node 24 and Node 26 / Windows. Graceful shutdown is tested separately through the same runtime shutdown function used by the SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers: it stops accepting HTTP requests, closes idle connections, completes the close callback, closes SQLite, and permits a successful database reopen. The integration test runs on Windows; delivery of operating-system console signals themselves is not asserted by the test.

## Reviewed controls (implementation inspection only)

| Area | Observation | Review state |
|---|---|---|
| Network binding | Server binds to `127.0.0.1` | Inspected; runtime verification still required |
| Host validation | HTTP handler accepts loopback Host names and rejects others | Inspected; parser edge cases need independent testing |
| HTTP limits | Header, request, body, keep-alive, and per-socket limits are configured | Inspected; existing integration coverage present |
| Credential separation | Operator and Participant credentials use distinct routes and checks; lease token is separately required for worker mutations | Inspected; independent adversarial testing pending |
| Token storage | Operator and Participant token hashes are stored; lease hashes are stored | Inspected; filesystem/database protection is an operational responsibility |
| Audit immutability | SQLite triggers reject event UPDATE and DELETE | Inspected; privileged filesystem/database access can bypass application-level guarantees |
| Dashboard | Operator token is held in page memory; dynamic values use `textContent`; no HTML injection sinks, console logging, or payload/result rendering | Static asset and source regression checks pass; interactive browser testing remains pending |
| Backup/restore | Dedicated backup and offline restore implementation exists | Not yet fully reviewed |
| Startup recovery | Expired active leases are reconciled before listening and periodically | Startup integration test exists; forced WAL termination and graceful runtime shutdown tests passed in CI on Node 24/26 Windows |

## Gate

Phase 4 security work remains **in progress**. This document is preparation for an independent review, not evidence that such a review has passed. Keep the API loopback-only until the independent review gate is completed.
